	    - WARN  | [libwebp/core, libwebp/utils, libwebp/dsp, and more...] xcodebuild:  libwebp/src/utils/bit_writer.c:262:11: warning: code will never be executed [-Wunreachable-code]
	    - NOTE  | [libwebp/core, libwebp/utils, libwebp/dsp, and more...] xcodebuild:  libwebp/src/utils/bit_writer.c:261:29: note: silence by adding parentheses to mark code as explicitly dead
	    - ERROR | [libwebp/webp, libwebp/core, libwebp/utils, and more...] xcodebuild: Returned an unsuccessful exit code. You can use `--verbose` for more information.
	    - NOTE  | [libwebp/webp, libwebp/core, libwebp/utils, and more...] xcodebuild:  xcodebuild: error: SDK "appletvsimulator" cannot be located.
